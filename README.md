### Hi I'm Om Bhojane 
I'm a passionate AI developer and hackathon enthusiast driven to build innovative solutions to real-world problems. With strong skills in User Interface Prototyping, and frameworks like React and Next.js, I create smooth, responsive web apps that users love.

Things I'm excited about: <br>
â€¢ Participating in hackathons and tech events - I love the thrill of quickly learning, collaborating, and building something new. It pushes me out of my comfort zone in the best way! <br>
â€¢ AI and its potential for impact - Machine learning and AI capabilities really excite me. I'm eager to work on projects that apply these technologies to tackle challenges that matter. <br>
â€¢ Turning ideas into products - I genuinely enjoy the process of bringing a concept to life in code. That includes thinking through application architecture, UI/UX design, development, testing, and iteration based on user feedback. <br>
